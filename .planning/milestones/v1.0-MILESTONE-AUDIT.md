# Milestone v1.0 Audit Report — @careagent/axon

**Audited:** 2026-02-22T18:00:00Z
**Status:** tech_debt (all requirements met, no blockers, minor documentation items)
**Score:** 41/41 requirements satisfied

## Executive Summary

Axon v1.0 is **complete**. All 41 requirements are satisfied across 7 phases (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5.1, 6). All core functionality — taxonomy, questionnaires, registry, protocol, broker, client facade, mock server, and documentation — is implemented, tested (231 passing tests), and cross-phase integration is fully verified.

The previous audit (2026-02-22T12:15:00Z) found 6 unsatisfied documentation requirements (DOCS-01 through DOCS-06). Phase 6 has since been executed and verified — all 6 gaps are now resolved.

3 minor documentation inaccuracies remain as tech debt. None affect runtime behavior.

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 6: Documentation and Release

| # | Item | Severity |
|---|------|----------|
| 1 | README.md line 270: physician.json described as "Full 12-question questionnaire" — actual count is 13 | Low |
| 2 | docs/questionnaire-authoring.md line 226: describes "12 questions" — actual is 13 | Low |
| 3 | README.md line 158: `new AxonRegistry()` missing required `filePath` argument | Low |

**Root cause:** Phase 2 Plan 03 added `surgical_subspecialty` (13th question) after earlier documentation was drafted. README constructor example was copied from plan without runtime verification.

### General

| # | Item | Severity |
|---|------|----------|
| 4 | ROADMAP.md Phase 6 plan checkboxes `[ ]` not updated to `[x]` | Info |
| 5 | 1 pending todo: `.planning/todos/pending/2026-02-21-build-permitted-actions-taxonomy.md` | Info |

**Total: 5 items across 2 categories. No blockers. No critical debt.**
