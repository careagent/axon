# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-21)

**Core value:** Trusted, open, neutral discovery and handshake layer so any patient CareAgent can find any provider CareAgent and establish a direct peer-to-peer connection -- without touching PHI or remaining in the path after handshake.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Package Foundation and Clinical Action Taxonomy

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Package Foundation and Clinical Action Taxonomy)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-02-21 -- Completed 01-03-PLAN.md (AxonTaxonomy static class with TDD, 46 tests, >80% coverage)

Progress: [██████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.28 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 17min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 8min, 5min, 4min
- Trend: improving

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 5 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from dependency graph; Phases 2 and 3 are independent (can run in parallel)
- [Roadmap]: Taxonomy granularity must be calibrated in Phase 1 before Phase 2 questionnaire authoring begins
- [01-01]: Removed isolatedDeclarations from tsconfig -- incompatible with TypeBox schema inference; all other strict flags retained
- [01-01]: Used fixedExtension: false in tsdown for .js/.d.ts output matching package.json exports
- [01-01]: TypeBox schemas define taxonomy data shapes; types derived via Static<typeof Schema>
- [01-02]: Mostly 2-level hierarchy with 3 levels only for surgical procedures (perform.surgical.*)
- [01-02]: 6 common cross-type actions explicitly list all 49 types; no inheritance
- [01-02]: Medication prescribing applicable_types includes dental, podiatry, vision_optometry beyond physician/APP
- [01-03]: Replaced createRequire JSON loading with readFileSync + directory walk-up for bundle compatibility
- [01-03]: Non-null assertion in _buildIndexes instead of defensive undefined guard (dead code elimination)
- [01-03]: Schema validation tested directly via TaxonomyVersionValidator for branch coverage
- [Phase 01]: Replaced createRequire JSON loading with readFileSync + directory walk-up for bundle compatibility
